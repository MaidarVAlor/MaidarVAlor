# welcome, traveller. i am Maidar Valor.
### first, let me introduce myself to you
i am also known as "Mva"/"EM-VEE-AY" and this is my readme.

empathy, kindness and sensitivity are the parts of my *emotional outfit*. i always have it worn, everywhere.

### now, showing my interests
some of my interests:
- 🎨 minimalistic arts... i just LOVE making them
- 🎮 gaming... well, not that much since 2019
- 🎲 D&D... is how i spend most of time with my trusties :)
- 🎧 metal... they way music should be made
- 🏋️‍♂️ working out... is my job. i wanna get that STR stat higher :)
- 🖋️ YA writing... is where my 2nd life exists

in the future:
- 🏹 becoming an archer... in the next year! no wonder why i said "working out is my job"
- ⚔️ HEMA, LARPing... maybe, who knows! the future will tell...

### random facts, not really interesting
fun facts:
1. "Maidar Valor" is not my real name. it's my character's name.
2. my outfit is pretty simple: some shoes, wide jeans, hood, gloves, mask, sunglasses and cap

### finally, the end
whatever, i just told you everything about me. you can always come back to this readme if you want.
